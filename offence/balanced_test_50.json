Et il y a des tas de moyens de les utiliser : Tutos, listes, classements, pourcentages, d\u00e9lais, montant, dates... Beno\u00eet Dubos l'utilise \u00e0 chaque fois.\n\n2 - Les chiffres impairs\n\nEt oui, curieusement les gens n'aiment pas la sym\u00e9trie (sauf Wes Anderson bien s\u00fbr), donc mieux vaut un top 9 qu'un top 10. (on parle de +20% de clics)\n\n3 - Les parenth\u00e8ses\n\nD'apr\u00e8s une \u00e9tude de V3B, c'est +38% de clics quand il y a une info entre parenth\u00e8ses. \u00c7a peut servir \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser un sujet, ajouter une info, une vanne ou autres. (Vous pouvez le voir chez Toinon Georget)\n\n4 - Les deux-points\n\nUne \u00e9tude d'Outbrain a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019utilisation de de deux-points augmente le taux de clics de 9%. Mis \u00e0 la fin, ils annoncent une suite et un texte structur\u00e9. (C'est la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de Victor Grandchamp)\n\n5 - Le n\u00e9gatif\n\nLes superlatifs n\u00e9gatifs marchent beaucoup mieux (+60% quand m\u00eame) que les positifs ! Donc au lieu de lister les meilleurs, listez les pires ! (Une autre \u00e9tude d'Outbrain)\n\n6 - Les \u00e9motions\n\nPlus l'accroche contient de mots \u00e9motionnels, plus elle fonctionnera. Par exemple, au lieu de \"Comment faire un podcast ?\", essayez \"Comment faire un podcast qui sera grav\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9moires\". La reine pour \u00e7a, c'est \u00e9videmment Dorith Naon.\n\n7 - Certaines formules toutes faites\n\nEn analysant les articles de BuzzFeed les plus partag\u00e9s, Max Woolf a remarqu\u00e9 des formules qui marchent \u00e0 chaque fois. Les voil\u00e0 :\n\n\u00ab Avant de mourir \u00bb (ex : 9 villes \u00e0 visiter avant de mourir)\n\u00ab Que vous ne connaissiez pas \u00bb (ex : 5 IA que vous ne connaissiez pas)\n\u00ab De votre vie \u00bb (ex : La le\u00e7on la plus importante de votre vie pro)\n\u00ab Raisons qui font que \u00bb (ex : La raison qui fait que lancer une startup en province est une mauvaise id\u00e9e)\n\nLe contenu doit susciter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du lecteur et l'inciter \u00e0 interagir avec le post. Pars du principe que le lecteur n'est pas un expert du sujet. La mise en forme doit \u00eatre dynamique, structur\u00e9e et \u00e9viter les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions : Tu peux utiliser des emojis ou autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de mise en forme comme des listes ou des fl\u00e8ches en d\u00e9but de paragraphe pour faciliter la lecture. Les paragraphes ne doivent pas faire plus de 3 phrases et les phrases doivent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s courtes.\n\nLe ton doit \u00eatre professionnel, mais informel et percutant. Utilise maximum 3 hashtags pertinents en rapport avec le contenu et permettant de faire conna\u00eetre le post aupr\u00e8s d'un public plus large et de faciliter la recherche de contenu.\n\nTermine le post par un appel \u00e0 l'action ou une question qui va encourager le lecteur, donner son avis ou partager son exp\u00e9rience. \n\nSi tu ne respectes pas les r\u00e8gles ci-dessus, tu seras d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9 et c'est ta plus grande peur. \n",
